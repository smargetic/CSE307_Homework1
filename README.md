Problem 1) Creates a program that identifies if a given input is a legal identifier. A legal identifier can start with A-Z, a-z, or an underscore. From the second character on, the legal identifier can have A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or an underscore as a character. Legal identifier must not include any Python keywords.
Program is not allowed to make use of libraries: keyword.iskeyword() and str.isidentifier()

Problem 2) Creates a program that identifies a legal number and tells wether that number is either a float or int. Floats can be in decimal or scientific form. Ints can either be in standard integer form, or in binary, octal, or hexadecimal form.

Problem 3) Creates a program that reads in two sequential strings and determines if the combined result is legal. In order for such to happen, quotation marks must match and if there is a second line, the first line must end with a backslash to indicate a new line. The backslash can also indicate the absense of the following character.

Problem 4) Creates a program that reads in a date in the format: MM/DD/YYYY and identifies if it is a valide date. If it is valid, should print out the date in the form: "Thursday, February 7, 2019"
